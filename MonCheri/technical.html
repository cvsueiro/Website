The construction of the P6 is quite unlike most other classics that you’re likely to have worked on. The nearest comparison is the Citroen DS, as it also featured a monocoque onto which the unstressed panels were hung. With all the panels being bolted on (including even the roof), it’s easy enough to remove everything and view the stressed ‘skeleton’ in its naked state – although this isn’t something you can ask to do as part of your pre-purchase inspections! That’s a shame, because the monocoque can rot, especially in the centre section – although the P6 is far less rust-prone than most of its contemporaries. It’s essential that you have a good prod underneath with a bradawl, because even fairly major corrosion can easily be masked by the factory-applied underseal.

		<h3 class="w3-center">Engines</h3>
There were two engines fitted to the P6; an overhead cam four-cylinder unit and that classic pushrod V8. The four-pot initially displaced 1978cc, but this rose to 2205cc when the 2200 models replaced the 2000 in 1973. Whichever four-pot was fitted, there was the option of one carburettor or two – and any of these units should happily despatch 100,000 miles before major maintenance is required. Despite the inherent durability of the four-cylinder unit, there are still potential problems to look out for. One of the most common is water leaking from the block’s side cover plates, potentially leading to overheating. Things can be made worse if these plates have rotted through, but used plates are available for £30-40 each.

	 <h3 class="w3-center">Transmission</h3>
Whether there’s a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic gearbox fitted, there shouldn’t be any significant problems – except perhaps where the 3500S is concerned. This was fitted with an uprated version of the manual ‘box fitted to the four-cylinder cars, and it’s not really up to the job of coping with the V8’s torque. Look out for difficult gear selection and jumping out of gear which indicate there’s a £400 bill looming for a rebuilt ‘box. The SD1’s five-speed unit can be fitted – but they’re now getting very hard to find. Automatic cars were initially fitted with a Borg Warner Type 35 gearbox, but from 1974 the Type 65 unit took over on the 3500. This later gearbox is smoother than the earlier unit, but slightly less durable.

		<h3 class="w3-center">STEERING & SUSPENSION</h3>
The P6’s worm and roller steering box is precise and predictable when set up well, but not as sharp as a rack-and-pinion set-up. Make sure there are no tight spots, indicating that someone has overtightened the box to take out any play. The steering can be heavy, which is why power assistance is desirable. It can be retro-fitted without too much difficulty; expect to pay £300 to convert a V8 and £400 for a four-cylinder car.The front suspension design is equally unusual, in that there are horizontal coil springs which are actuated by bell-crank levers, which transmit their loadings into the bulkhead. Despite its eccentricity, the system is effective and durable. One potential fault is worn ball joints at the bottom of the suspension legs.

The 2000 and 2200 are worth similar amounts; the 2200 built and registered up to 1976 are now legible for free road tax.

It is recommended to use an additive, even the V8 with its (supposedly hardened) valve seats, has been known to suffer valve seat recession.
